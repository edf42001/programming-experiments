# kd_tree

Experiments to learn of kd and oct trees work (and quad trees, which are just 2D octrees)

## Basic Usage

Run `./quadtree.py` to visualize a quad tree formed from random data

Run `./kd_tree.py` to see the text output demonstrating proper kd tree formation of a list of number pairs. No visualization for this one, as it is not as straightforward as the quad tree
