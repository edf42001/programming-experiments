# Cow Vs Aliens

This video game was a project for my high school computer science class. I am extremely proud of the result.
You play as a cow, saving the galaxy by shooting your way through 20 unique levels. 
Here are some of my game's features:

* Animated title
* Working menu and level select screen
* 7 unique enemies
* 20 different levels
* Sound effects and background music
* Hit and death animations
* Controller support (tested on a mac computer, in 2018)
