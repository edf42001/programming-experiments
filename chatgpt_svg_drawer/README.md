# chatGPT SVG Drawer

In this project, I want to get started with the chatGPT developer API by asking it to return SVG
code that draws things, then display it (in Python).

I will use a system prompt to put chatGPT in SVG drawing mode, then allow users to
enter something to draw. I will then parse the output and convert it to an image to be displayed.
