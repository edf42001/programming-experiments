Interesting software projects I wanted to test out

## Current Projects:

### aido
Collection of neural network tests to learn how to use AI to compete in the aido driving challenge

### kalman_filters
Just experimenting with kalman filters, testing different ways of combining more than one sensor

### kd_tree
Learning how kd trees and octrees work

### least_cost_graph_solver
A dynamic programming approach to finding the optimal path through a graph. Useful for optimization problems

### particle_filter
A monte-carlo particle filter for robot localization using landmarks

### written_digits_gan
Experiment with a generative adverarial network to generate MNIST handwritten digits. Learned how to train networks on AWS EC2 Instances

### java_projects
A collection of projects written in high school. Including:
* MandelbrotSet: Mandelbrot set visualization
* CowVsAliens: Shootemup video game
* ComplexFunctionViewer: Visualizes complex functions in the 2D plane
* Connect4: A Connect 4 AI
* GeneticAlgorithmBoxes: Genetic algorithm for boxes learning to catch falling fruit
* GeneticAlgorithmDots: Genetic algorithm for dots learning to navigate through a small gap
