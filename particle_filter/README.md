# particle_filter

Experiments with particle_filters, for possible use in the NASA Robotics Mining Competition. Testing the effectiveness of the particle filter for different types of sensor data, and different probabalistic sensor models.

## Basic Usage
Run `./particle_filter_main.py`. Close the matplotlib window to watch the cycle of motion-update-resample steps as the particle filter localizes.
