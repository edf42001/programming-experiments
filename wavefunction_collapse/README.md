# WaveFunction Collapse

Inspired by the video tutorial [Coding Challenge 171: Wave Function Collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM), I set out to program the wave function collapse algorithm in C++, instead of the original JavaScript.

Wave function collapse takes inspiration from quantum mechanics to generate unique and interesting patterns. For example, the circuit board below is made of 13 unique tiles, which can only connect to other tiles with matching edges. As part of the pattern is laid down, it restricts the possibilities for the rest of the pattern, and eventually the whole image “collapses” into one of many possible states.

For displaying images, I use the basic functionality of Mats from OpenCV. I have extensive OpenCV experience in Python, and wanted to build proficiency in C++ as well.
